 church in EastAfrica. At the time it was called Bugema Missionary Training School. 
 Later, the name was changed to Bugema Missionary college and then Bugema Adventist College.
In 1976 Bugema Adventist college received authorisation from the uganda Ministry of Education and 
the General conference of seventh day Adventists to offer a BTh degree. The college had applied to offer 
a BA in Theology but Ministry of Education denied the application because at that time, only Makerere was
permitted to offer academic degrees. There were about 33 students in the program. The proffessorswere
Pastor and Mrs. Villagomez and Pastor Gray Fordham. After President Idi Amin banned the seventh day Adventist
church in 1977, the program was temporarily moved to Nairobi where the 1st degree students graduated with BTh
degree in 1978. The campus was then relocated to the Chuch's youth camp at Watamu just northof Mombasa until 
Amin fled Uganda. While the college was at Watamu,Reuben Mugerwa finished his graduate degree Andrews UN and
joined the facaulty .The college was then moved back to the Bugema campus.
